# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
The prework study guide webpage hosts a simple collection of introductory work I performed in preparation for the UW Bootcamp starting on August 22nd. This collection is composed of a simple HTML file, CSS file, and Javascript file to act as a reference for learning these tools. I learned how HTML, CSS, and Javascript interact with each other while building this site.

## Installation
No installation necessary.

## Usage
This site can be used to review a few introductory topics on HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. If you open the DevTools on your browser, you can see the javascript script in action.
